## Coming soon!
### Full post in progress. 

In the meantime, I'd like to thank the [Paleontological Society](https://www.paleosoc.org/) and the [Society of Vertebrate Paleontology](https://vertpaleo.org/) for the grant awards that got this project off the ground.

And a thank you to the [Webb Schools](https://www.webb.org/) for providing funding for our students first expedition!

The robot and students performed exceptionally! But, more details on that soon...stay tuned.
