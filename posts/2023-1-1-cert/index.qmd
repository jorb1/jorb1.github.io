## Course Description: 

From the [iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/) website: 

"The goal of the course is for the students to produce a short (5–10 pages) strategic plan for their collection. Each plan will address vision, mission, values, stakeholders, strategies, goals, objectives, evaluation, and sustainability, among other things.

- Lesson 1 focuses on Stakeholders, Mission, Vision, and Core Values in addition to introducing participants to the course;
- Lesson 2 focuses on Strategies, Goals, Objectives, and Value Proposition; 
- Lesson 3 focuses on Environmental Scan (SWOT/TOWS analysis);
- Lesson 4 focuses on Sustainability (addressing the SWOT/TOWS analysis);
- Lesson 5 focuses on Evaluation, including Logic Models, Metrics, Benchmarks, and Milestones;
- Lesson 6 focuses on bringing everything together into a cohesive Strategic Plan, developing an Executive Summary, and adding Acknowledgements;
- Lesson 7 focuses on elements of design and formatting, developing a one-page strategic plan, and developing an elevator pitch; and
- Lesson 8 focuses on peer feedback and how to continually improve, communicate, and implement the Strategic Plan."
