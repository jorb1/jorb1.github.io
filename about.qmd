What I do for work

<p class="title">some test goes here </p>

## Nice to meet you, I’m Bailey.

<p class="orange-text" center-text>*Data collection and management is my day-passion. Marine secrets and wonders are my life-passion. When I’m not deepening my technical knowledge of data and coding at
UC Santa Barbara Bren, caring for an active research collection and exhibits hall at the Alf Museum of Paleontology takes up most of my professional time. Sailing and preserving historic wooden ships for maritime museums and institutes ignited my interest in the heritage
sector. Paleontological fieldwork and data collection in the
deserts of Utah, California, Wyoming, Montana and Mongolia solidified it. Have a project in the biodiversity heritage sector? (Bonus points if its for marine environments.) Let’s chat!*</p>
